 * keep-alive: <len=0000>.

 * The keep-alive message is a message with zero bytes, specified with the length prefix set to zero.
 * There is no message ID and no payload. Peers may close a connection if they receive no messages
 * (keep-alive or any other message) for a certain period of time, so a keep-alive message must be
 * sent to maintain the connection alive if no command have been sent for a given amount of time.
 * This amount of time is generally two minutes.
